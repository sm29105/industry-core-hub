    Manager for handling submodel service operations (read, write, delete).
    
    Uses lazy initialization to ensure efficient adapter creation and configuration.
    Features 100% dynamic adapter initialization based on configuration via SubmodelAdapterFactory.
    Supports multiple storage backends:
    - FileSystem (local storage)
    - S3 (AWS S3 or S3-compatible)
    - HttpSubmodel (external submodel service)
    
    Singleton Pattern Infrastructure:
    The singleton pattern infrastructure (__new__ method) is prepared but not currently enforced.
    This allows flexibility for potential future use. Currently, lazy initialization via __init__
    is used to initialize the adapter only once per application runtime.
    
    Configuration is loaded from YAML and passed to the factory without any hardcoded logic
    or switch statements. Adapter type and configuration are determined dynamically from
    the configuration section: provider.submodel_dispatcher
    
    Example:
        # Initialize adapter from configuration
        manager = SubmodelServiceManager()
        
        # Subsequent instantiations initialize the same way (due to lazy initialization)
        manager2 = SubmodelServiceManager()

        Initialize SubmodelServiceManager with lazy initialization pattern.
        
        Implements lazy initialization to create the adapter instance only once during
        application runtime. The _initialized flag tracks whether initialization has occurred.
        
        Note on Singleton Pattern:
        The singleton __new__() method is prepared but currently commented out. If enabled
        in the future, it will enforce that only one manager instance exists application-wide.
        The current lazy initialization pattern provides similar benefits for typical usage.
        
        Configuration flow:
        1. On first instantiation: ConfigManager.get_adapter_mode_and_config() retrieves
           both adapter mode and configuration from provider.submodel_dispatcher section
        2. Passes to SubmodelAdapterFactory.from_config() → creates adapter instance
